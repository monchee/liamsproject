This study identified that there was a high false positive rate of many of the autoantibodies tested. Some, like striated muscle antibody, were not likely to provide meaningful information due to a high false positive rate. Additionally, antibodies against the central nervous system were often unnecessarily tested in line with those directed against the peripheral nervous system. Those results lead to unnecessary further evaluation of patients with imaging and biopsy. This is a wasteful practice which may be causing harm.</p> <p>A review by Public Pathology Australia in 2012 detailed the crisis of inappropriate pathology requesting and called for more real time clinical decision support for computerized physician order entry systems 2. A recent systematic review identified that CDSS were able to reduce test volume and cost 3 and may be useful in solving this problem.</p> <p>There are now a great number of autoantibodies known to be directed against antigens present in the nervous system.
