# Field Definitions

Breakdown of each section when navigating through the site.

##  Description	
### What it is
A single sentence comprising key pieces of information which serves as a ‘top line’ summary from which a clinician will gain the most information at a glance.

- Might be expressed in a lab report comment and might be read quickly by the clinician when reviewing results before seeing a patient.
- May include some or all of previous definitions including but not limited to target antigen, expression pattern, antigen location, molecular characteristics.
- May include some important components like “pittfalls” and “most helpful”.
- Where available would include whether the autoantibody is best detected in the CSF or serum.

### What it is not
A sentence which confuses the user (e.g. aims to use terms such as “highly associated” instead of “associated with 20-40% of cases of ADEM” which is unclear whether 20-40% of positive cases have ADEM or if 20-40% of ADEM have positive autoantibodies).

Information plagiarised from other authors without credit.

- E.g. “Anti-NF155 is an autoantibody usually of the IgG4 isotype associated with a rare autoimmune paranodopathy presenting with ataxic neuropathy formerly considered part of the spectrum of CIDP.”
- E.g. “Anti-SOX1 is an autoantibody directed against an intracellular antigen highly expressed in the cerebellar cortex, strongly associated with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome and small cell lung cancer.”
- E.g. “Anti-MOG is an IgG antibody often found in cases of anti-AQ4 negative neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder and is associated with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis.”

## Mechanism of action	

### How the antibody is thought to be pathological

 - e.g. *anti-NMDAR cross linking and internalisation of the receptor.*
 - Functional (i.e. inhibitory or stimulatory).
 - Localised cell damage either through cytotoxic cellular effects or complement mediated damage.
 - Unknown.

### Where the autoantibody acts

 - E.g. anti-LGI1 targets a part of the VGKC complex at the cell surface.
 - E.g. Anti-Hu targets an intracellular protein."

## Associated clinical features

of the syndrome associated with the antibody

## Associated neoplasia

to describe the most common malignancies associated with the antibody and to identify whether the antibody is high (>70%), intermediate (30-70%), or lower risk (<30%) for an associated malignancy.

## Laboratory method

Indirect immunofluorescence, cell based assay, flow cytometry, radioimmunoprecipitation/fluorescence immunoprecipitation, ELISA.

## Notes on performance characteristics of the test

## Grade

A standardised score or expert panel opinion on the ‘health’ of the assay. 

Includes the pitfalls of and most useful applications of this test.

Takes into account several components including: access to the assay, cost, performance characteristics, availability of certified reference material"

## Next steps

Might include comments on prognosis, treatment efficacy, relapse rate, disease activity, and disease classification.
