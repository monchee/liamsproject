| 89  | AK5                             | The predominant symptom was severe episodic amnesia in all patients, and this was frequently associated with depression (17/25, 68.0%). Weight loss, asthenia and anorexia were also highly characteristic, being present in 11/25 (44.0%) patients. Although epilepsy was always lacking at disease onset, seizures developed later in a subset of patients (4/25, 16.0%). All patients presented CSF abnormalities, such as pleocytosis (18/25, 72.0%), oligoclonal bands (18/25, 72.0%) and increased Tau (11/14, 78.6%). Temporal lobe hyperintensities were almost always present at disease onset (23/26, 88.5%), evolving nearly invariably towards severe atrophy in subsequent MRIs (17/19, 89.5%). This finding was in line with a poor response to immunotherapy, with only 5/25 (20.0%) patients responding.
