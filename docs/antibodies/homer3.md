# Homer-3



## Description
Anti-Homer-3 antibodies are associated with cerebellitis, myeloradiculopathy, and REM sleep behaviour disorder and, even with intensive initial immunosuppression, often result in permanent ataxia and functional impairment.

## Mechanism of action
Homer-3 is richly expressed in the dendritic spines of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. Autoantibody likely not pathogenic but rather the disease may be T cell mediated.

## Associated clinical features
Cerebellar ataxia, encephalopathy, myeloradiculopathy, REM sleep behaviour disorder, autonomic dysfunction, MRI brain may show cerebellar atrophy or 'Hot Cross Bun Sign', may present similarly to multisystem atrophy with cerebellar features.

## Associated neoplasia
None

## Laboratory method
Largest case series used both cell based and tissue based assays.

## Next steps
Likely to live with long term cerebellar dysfunction and disability even with therapy. Early and possibly aggressive treatment is recommended.
