# TRIM46

## **Tripartite motif-containing protein 46**

### Description
TRIM46-IgG is newly described biomarker of a range of paraneoplastic CNS disorders  including cerebellar syndromes, encephalopathy and seizures, limbic encephalitis, brainstem encephalitis, myelopathy, parkinsonism/dystonia.

### Mechanism of action
Paraneoplastic syndromes

### Associated clinical features
In an initial series of 22 patients subacute cerebellar syndrome (six isolated; nine with CNS accompaniments: encephalopathy (three), brainstem signs (two), myelopathy (two), parkinsonism (one)). Other phenotypes included limbic encephalitis (three), encephalopathy with/without seizures (two), myelopathy (two). 

### Associated neoplasia
HIGH RISK: In an initial series of 22 patients,  18 (82%) had cancer: neuroendocrine carcinomas (9; pancreatic (3), small-cell lung (4), oesophagus (1), endometrium (1)), adenocarcinomas (6; lung (2), ovarian (2), endometrial (1), breast (1)), sarcoma (2) and gastrointestinal tumour (1). Neurological symptoms in three patients followed immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) administration. See reference
