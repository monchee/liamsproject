# TRIM46

## **Tripartite motif-containing protein 46**

### Description
TRIM46-IgG is newly described biomarker of a range of paraneoplastic CNS disorders  including cerebellar syndromes, encephalopathy and seizures, limbic encephalitis, brainstem encephalitis, myelopathy, parkinsonism/dystonia.

### Mechanism of action
Paraneoplastic syndromes

### Associated clinical features
In an initial series of 22 patients subacute cerebellar syndrome (6 isolated; 9 with CNS accompaniments: encephalopathy (3), brainstem signs (2), myelopathy (2), parkinsonism (1)). 

Other phenotypes included limbic encephalitis (3), encephalopathy with/without seizures (2), myelopathy (2). 

### Associated neoplasia
!!! danger "High risk"

In an initial series of 22 patients,  18 (82%) had cancer:

- Neuroendocrine carcinomas (9)

    * Pancreatic (3)
    * Small-cell lung (4)
    * Oesophagus (1)
    * Endometrium (1)

- Adenocarcinomas (6)
    * Lung (2)
    * Ovarian (2)
    * Endometrial (1)
    * Breast (1)
    * Sarcoma (2)
    * Gastrointestinal tumour (1)

Neurological symptoms in three patients followed immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) administration.
