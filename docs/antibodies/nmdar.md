# NMDAR

## Site of action
N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor

## Description
Anti-NMDA receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis is an immune-mediated disease characterised by a complex neuropsychiatric syndrome and the presence of CSF anti- bodies against the GluN1 subunit of the NMDAR.

## Mechanism of action
Antibody mediated endocytosis and destruction of NMDAR complexes which results in decreased density of receptors on the neuronal surface.

## Associated clinical features
 - **In children**: seizures, abnormal movements, insomnia, irritability
 - **In adults**: psychosis and abnormal behaviour, memory impairment, hypoventilation and temperature dysregulation
 - *Include SEARCH For NMDAR-A as diagnostic clues? (sleep dysfunction, excitement/disinhibition/mania/depression, agitation/aggression, rapid onset, children and young adult predominance, psychiatric disease absent, fluctuating catatonia, negative and positive symptoms at presentation, memory deficit, mutism, antipsychotic intolerance, rule out neuroleptic malignant syndrome, antibodies and additional tests"*

## Associated neoplasia
Most commonly ovarian tumours in females aged 12-45y (50% association), Elderly patients less frequently have tumours (<25%) but are usually carcinomas, in children paraneoplastic cases are rare (<10%) (**this has been approximately copied from Graus et al and might need different wording**). [^1]

## Laboratory method
CSF or serum for a cell based assay: HEK293 cells expressing NMDAR.

## Notes of performance characteristics
With serum, chance (2-14%) of false positives and negatives if no confirmatory tests (e.g. brain immunostaining). This drawback is avoided if CSF is used.

## Grade

## Next steps
Suggest assertive early management which is associated with good outcome. 12% within the first 2 years of disease will have a less severe relapse.
