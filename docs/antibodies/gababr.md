# GABAbR

## **Gamma-aminobutyric acid-B receptor**

### Description
Autoantibody usually of the IgG1 isotype directed against the GABAb1 subunit of the GABAb receptor. The dominant clinical presentation is limbic encephalitis with seizures. More than half of patients either already have detectable SCLC or will develop it following diagnosis. Serum more sensitive than CSF on commercial CBA however CSF is more sensitive on live assays.

### Mechanism of action
GABAb receptors are G protein coupled receptors made up of the GABAb1 and GABAb2 subunits. They are most highly expressed in the hippocampus, thalamus, and cerebellum but may be found throughout the CNS. GABAb receptors mediate presynaptic inhibition, attenuate presynaptic firing frequencies, and indue slow inhibitory post synaptic potential. 

The anti-GABAb autoantibodies target the GABAb1 subunit which is necessary for GABA binding and receptor function. Thus the presence of these autoantibodies will impair the action of GABA on its receptor and reduction of pre and post synaptic inhibition.

### Associated clinical features
<div class="annotate" markdown>
- Limbic encephalitis manifesting as seizures in 96.6% (1) 
- Cognitive impairment in 81%
- Psychiatric disturbance in 77.6%, and disturbed level of conscoiusness in 55.2%
- Memory loss, confusion
- EEG abnormal in 60% (epileptiform changes and general slowing)
- MRI abnormal in 63% (showing limbic encephalitis)
- CSF abnormal in >74% (pleocytosis and/or elevated protein)
- Rapidly progressive dementia
- Rarely opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome or gait ataxia
</div>

1. Almost all patients will experience generalised seizures but may have other phenotypes: 15% focal to bilateral tonic clonic, 19% focal with impaired awareness, and 12% focal

### Associated neoplasia
More than 50% associated with malignancy, most often SCLC which may not be present at time of diagnosis.

### Laboratory method
<div class="grid" markdown>

:material-flask: Commercial CBA
{ .card }

</div>

Indirect Immunohistochemistry looking for staining in the cortex and subcortical gray matter with strong positivity of hippogampus and molecular layer of the cerebellum.
Live rat hippocampal neuronal assay

### Notes of performance characteristics
<div class="grid cards" markdown>
  
-   __Commercial fixed CBA__

    ---

    * CSF sensitivity 84%
    * Serum sensitivity 96%
    * Serum specificity 99.7%
  
    Addition of KCTD16 to an in house fixed CBA will improve sensitivity to that of the commercial fixed CBA and can identify higher titres in CSF and serum. Specificity was unaffected in this study.

### Grade

### Next steps
85% will respond to immunotherapy. Median improvement in mRS to 2 after immunotherapy. 

Seizure freedom may be achieved by median of 6 days of immunotherapy and usually occurs earlier than cognitive symptoms which will improve by median of 35 days. Detailed data on relapse is not available. Median survival is 17 months and is not different for those with tumour.

The presence of KCTD16 antibodies increases the probability of a paraneopastic origin.
