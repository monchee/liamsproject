# SOX-1

## **Sry-like high mobility group box 1**

### Other names
**Anti-glial nuclear antibody**

### Description
Anti-SOX-1 is an antibody directed against an intracellular antigen highly expressed in the cerebellar cortex which is associated with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration and less frequently limbic encephalitis, typically associated with small cell lung cancer. 

SOX-1 was first identified as the antigen recognized by [anti-glial nuclear antibodies (AGNA)](#).  

### Mechanism of action
Onconeuronal antibodies usually target intracellular antigens that are expressed in both neuronal tissues and cancer cells. They are generally not directly pathogenic. 

Tissue injury tends to arise from a parallel cytotoxic T cell response, which results in irreversible neuronal damage and cell death, corresponding to guarded responses to current immunosuppressive approaches.

### Associated clinical features
- Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome
- Cerebellar degeneration
- Limbic encephalitis
- Peripheral neuropathy.

### Associated neoplasia
!!! error "High risk"
    -  >80% of cases of Anti-SOX-1 antibody will have concomitant small cell lung cancer. 
    - 4% have non small cell lung cancer. 
    - 1.7% have other malignancies. 

More strongly associated with SCLC than with a particular neurologic presentation. SOX-1 antibodies have also been identified in rare cases of sensory neuropathy following immune checkpoint inhibition for cancer.

### Notes of performance characteristics
Commercial line-blot assays may fail to identify 25% of the cases; cell-based assays may be more sensitive.[^3]

    High risk for malignancy, investigate promptly for lung cancer.
