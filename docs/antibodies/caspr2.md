# CASPR2

## **Contactin associated protein 2**

### Description
Anti-CASPR2 antibodies are of the IgG1 and IgG4 isotypes directed against a component of the VGKC in the central and peripheral nervous systems. They are more often associated with peripheral than central manifestations. 

Thymoma is present in 20-50% of cases. Anti-CASPR2 antibodies may coexist with anti-LGI1 antibodies.

### Mechanism of action
CASPR2 is expressed throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems. 

- **In the CNS**: it is expressed in the cerebellum, CA1 and CA3 hippocampal and pyramidal cells, olfactory bulb, and white matter tracts. 
- **In the PNS**: it is found in the juxtaparanodes of myelinated axons. Anti-CASPR2 antibodies disrupt CASPR2 or internalise the VGKC complex. 
- **At other times**: the antibody will disrupt CASPR2 interactions with neighbouring proteins. Some patients show reduced CMAP and SNAP amplitudes.

### Associated clinical features
- Seizures in 49% (predominantly complex partial) 
- Epileptiform EEG
- Limbic encephalitis 
- Cognitive decline 
- Abnormal neuropsychological examination 
- Personality change
- Hallucinations
- Depression
- Insomnia
- REM sleep behaivour disorder
- Abnormal polysomnogram
- Hyponatraemia in 7%
- Morvan's syndrome
- Neuropathic pain
- Sweat abnormalities
- 8:1 male to female
- EMG hyperexcitability
- EMG neuropathy
- Cramps
- Sensory and motor symptoms
- Nerve conduction abnormalities
- Tilt test positive
- MRI abnormal
- PET abnormal
- CSF may be normal

### Associated neoplasia
Thymoma in 20-50% of cases. (1) Risk of malignancy very low in other neurological syndromes associated with this autoantibody.

1. Particularly in cases of Morvan's syndrome and neuromyotonia. 

### Laboratory method
<div class="grid" markdown>

:material-flask: Cell based assay
{ .card }

</div>

Indirect immunofluoresence on rat brain

In cases of negative above assays and strongly characteristic clinical features then live hippocampal neuronal assays could be considered if accessible (1) 
{ .annotate }

1. May need to have a list of labs here, or S Irani's lab if none other available

### Notes of performance characteristics
Commercial CBA ([Euroimmun](https://www.euroimmun.com/)) using CSF has a sensitivity of 66.7% and specificity of 100% for anti-CASPR2 antibodies.

!!! warning
    **Do not order** with anti-VGKC antibodies due to low clinical yield of 'double negative anti-VGKC' results.
